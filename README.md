## Version 2.0 of a project which generates a random username using vanilla JavaScript and a bootstrap front-end.

Creates random two+ string phrases by pulling from a dataset cleaned words.

The project is live with a basic interface.

### How to use:

- The page will generate and display the first word set.
- Click on the generated words to get another random set.

### Design decisions:
I created the application to help make different random usernames when creating accounts online. I frequently use this application and found that a button to copy to clipboard would be really useful.
